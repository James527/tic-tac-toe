TIC TAC TOE

Technologies Used:
HTML, CSS, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery
Thanks to MeyerReset and Danniel Edenâ€™s Awesome CSS Transition Animations

Approach Taken:
I built from the ground up, started with HTML, got a basic grid going, achieved basic functionality, then I started adding extra stylings, transition animations, and modals, where debugging increased.

Installation Instructions:
Keep all the files together, place it in the directory where you want it, and open up the index.html file in your browser of choice and enjoy!

Unsolved Problems:
There are still some styling issues with the modal overlays. Responsive design works but could be improved. Cat and Dog images need to be touched up in Photoshop by someone who knows how to Photoshop.
