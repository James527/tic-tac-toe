Big Goals:

Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
Use your programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete
Craft a readme.md file that explains your app to the world
Technical Requirements

Your app must:

Render a game board in the browser
Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"catâ€™s game" if neither wins
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

Bonus:

These are for extra credit! Don't focus on these until you've hit the core requirements.

Use a data storage system (LocalStorage) to save users' games or their progress within an individual game
Add a move timer into the game to make sure users make a move in the allotted amount of time.
Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter
Allow players to customize their tokens (X, O, name, picture, etc)
Get inventive with your styling, e.g. use hover effects or animations to spiff things up
Create a computer player so a user can play against the computer.

Necessary Deliverables:

A working game, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your Github repo
A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
